# Predicting-the-next-word-in-trained-on-Shakespeare-s-Hamlet-using-GRU-or-LSTM
This project implements a next word prediction model using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) or LSTM neural network, trained on Shakespeare's "Hamlet". The model can predict the next word in a sequence based on the input text, demonstrating the application of deep learning in natural language processing.
